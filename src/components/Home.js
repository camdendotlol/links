      <h2>Welcome to Links</h2>
      <p>This webpage was created as part of Full Stack Open, although I have not been shy about making opinionated design choices that contradict the examples given in the course. The course exercises call this a &quot;blog list&quot; but I thought it made more sense to refer to them as links.</p>
      <p>You can post links to any content on the internet, as long as you fill out the author and title.</p>
      <p>All posts are tagged with the full name of the user who posted them, but of course pseudonyms are allowed.</p>
